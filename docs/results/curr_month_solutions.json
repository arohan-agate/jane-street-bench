        "answer": "Here's a brief reasoning and the final answer:\n\nThe optimal value of a should balance the time lost by cars in the slow lane having to stop versus the time lost by cars in the fast lane having to slow down to switch lanes. As the car trip length N approaches infinity, this optimal value converges to the golden ratio conjugate (2-\u221a5)/2.\n\nTherefore, the limit of [the limit of f(z,N) as z -> 0+] as N -> infinity is:\n\n0.3819660113",

        "answer": "To minimize the miles not driven due to passing, we should set the minimum speed of the fast lane (and maximum speed of the slow lane) to be the median speed of the cars.\n\nSince the car speeds are uniformly distributed between 1 and 2 miles per minute, the median speed is 1.5 miles per minute. This ensures that half the cars will be in the fast lane and half in the slow lane, minimizing the need for passing and deceleration.\n\nTherefore, the limit of [the limit of f(z,N) as z -> 0+] as N -> infinity is 1.5000000000 miles per minute.",
