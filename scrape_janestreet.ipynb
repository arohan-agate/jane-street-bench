A knight arrives ata1at timeT=0, and wishes to travel to the upper-right corner (h8). This lattice respresents a3-dimensional landscape; the numbers at each \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cpoint\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d represent theiraltitudes.\\nBut there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a big problem here, which is that this grid was built on a swamp, and the lattice points are prone tosinking. Whenever the knight arrives on a lattice point of altitudeA, that point andall others with the same altitudestart sinking at the rate of 1 unit pernminutes, wherenis the number of lattice points of altitudeA. Furthermore, the lattice pointdiametrically oppositethe one the knight is onrisesat the rate of 1 unit pernminutes. This sinking (and rising) continues only while the knight remains stationary, which may be for as much or as little time as the knight chooses. No other points move or begin to move during this time. (Altitudes can become negative. In the event that the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009copposite\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d point is at the same initial altitude, it neither rises nor sinks, and is ignored for the purpose of calculatingn.)\\nThe knight is only allowed to make 3-dimensional jumps that are permutations of (0,\\u00c2\\u00b11,\\u00c2\\u00b12) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 that is, jumps that move exactly 0 units in one dimension, exactly 1 unit in another, and exactly 2 units in the third. Jumps take 0 time to complete. In the spirit of a knight\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ctour\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, your goal is to find the path to the upper-right corner that takesas much time as possible. Tours of180 minutes or longerare eligible for the leaderboard.\\nUpdated 11/6:Due to some shortsightedness on our part we forgot to include the following extra rule. All \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009csinks\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in a tour must benecessarysinks. That is, if a jump (t, P) hast> 0, itmustbe the case that there exists a valuet\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099such that replacing (t, P) with (t\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099, P) would result in an illegal moveorwould cause a move later in the tour to be illegal. (Our tour operator regrets the oversight.)\\nTo enter, send in acomma-separated list of moves. Please use the notation (t,P) to describe a move, wheretis the number of minutes you wait at your current lattice point before jumping to lattice pointP. (The 19-move sequence in the example above would begin \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c(1,b3), (0,a3), (0,a2),\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d.) Your tour ends as soon as you first reachh8; all other lattice points may be visited at most 3 times. (Your starting state ata1counts towards this limit.)\\nUpdated 11/21:We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve really enjoyed the variety of tours we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve received thus far!

At some places, the digits from the two problems\\nwere both positive and had a greatest common divisor that was larger\\nthan 1.Allof those spots are marked with their respective GCDs.\\nThe answer to this puzzle is thesumof the two 7-digit dividends in\\nthe completed long division problems.\",\n          \"Back in October, we were tasked with the puzzle of finding the\\nsmallest number of robots we could invite to a Robot Swimming Trial in\\norder to change the optimal strategy of participants away from\\ndiscrete.Click\\nhereto see the original puzzle explanation and example; in the next\\nparagraph we will go over a quick refresher on the setup.\\nThe tournament directors choose a positive integerN, and then 3Nrobots are invited to compete in the trials, which areNraces between\\nall 3Nrobots. The robots commit to using a schedule of their\\nidentical fuel amounts to theNraces, and on a given race whatever\\nrobot burns the most fuel wins (ties for most fuel spent on a given\\nrace are split uniformly randomly among the tying robots). All robots\\nswim in all races according to their schedules, and thenNdistinct\\nwinners are determined, one from each race, by successively selecting\\nthe robot from the remaining races that spent the most fuel and\\nfinished ahead of all other robots that haven\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t yet won a race. Robots\\nall compete (i.e. choose their fuel allotment distributions to\\nmaximize the probability) to be selected for the finals by this\\nmethod. The discrete strategy is the one in which a robot chooses a\\nrace uniformly randomly and assigns all of its fuel to that race, and\\nzero fuel to the other races.\\nWe found (spoiler alert!) that inviting 24 robots to compete in 8\\ntrial races (i.e.N=8) created a tournament in which the discrete\\nstrategy was no longer optimal. The tournament organizers adopted this\\ntournament size, and viewers were rewarded with a richer set of\\nstrategies and more diverse race results1. As expected, the\\ncompetitors switched from everyone always using the discrete strategy\\nto more subtle and continuous allotments of fuel. The metagame evolved\\nand eventually settled into aNash\\nequilibriumin which\\na given competitor chooses the discrete strategy with a certain\\nprobabilityp, and otherwise elects for an allotment that\\ndistributes nonzero fuel to at least two races.\\nFindp, the probability a robot using the Nash equilibrium strategy\\nwhen competing at a Robot Updated Swimming Trial withN=8 devotes\\nall of its fuel to a single race,to 6 significant digits.\\nAlso, many fewer extremely slow races in which all robots devoted zero fuel, and whichever robot\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s random motion took it across the finish line first was declared the winner.\\u00c2\\u21a9\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hasImage\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"imagePaths\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 99,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/content/drive/MyDrive/cse493g1/project/data/puzzles/puzzle_images/Rather Square Sudoku/0_0.png\",\n          \"/content/drive/MyDrive/cse493g1/project/data/puzzles/puzzle_images/Circle Time/0_0.PNG\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hasSolution\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"solutionLink\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 134,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/chain-reaction-solution\",\n          \"https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/knight-moves-3-solution\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"solutionText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 134,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tough, open-ended puzzle this month!
